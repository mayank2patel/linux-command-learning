# rm (Remove)

In Linux, it's common to accumulate files that are no longer needed. To delete them, you use the `rm` (remove) command, a fundamental utility for managing your filesystem.

```bash
rm [OPTIONS] FILE...
```

The `rm` command removes directory entries from the filesystem — in normal terms, it deletes files. Unlike many desktop environments, command-line deletion usually does **not** move files to a trash folder, so you should check your command before pressing Enter.

> 🧠 **Think of it like…** feeding a document to a shredder — there's no recycle bin to fish it back out of, so aim carefully.

## Remove a Single File

To remove one file, pass the filename to `rm`.

```bash
rm file1
```

You can remove several files at once by listing them one after another.

```bash
rm notes.txt old-report.txt draft.md
```

This is useful for quick cleanup, but it also means a typo can delete more than you intended.

## Remove Files with Wildcards

Shell wildcards let you match multiple files. For example, this removes every `.tmp` file in the current directory:

```bash
rm *.tmp
```

Before using `rm` with a wildcard, it is safer to preview the match with `ls`.

```bash
ls *.tmp
cache.tmp  test.tmp

rm *.tmp
```

Remember that the shell expands `*.tmp` **before** `rm` runs. If the pattern matches more files than expected, `rm` will still receive all of them.

## Interactive Deletion with -i

For a safer approach, use the `-i` option. It prompts you before deleting each file.

```bash
rm -i important.txt
rm: remove regular file 'important.txt'? y
```

Use `rm -i` when deleting files from a shared directory, cleaning up many files, or learning the command for the first time.

## Forceful Deletion with -f

The `-f` option means *force*. It ignores nonexistent files and does not prompt for confirmation.

```bash
rm -f old-cache.txt
```

This is useful in scripts where cleanup should continue even if a file is already gone. Be careful: `-f` also suppresses some safety prompts, so it can hide mistakes.

## Removing Directories with -r

By default, `rm` cannot delete a directory.

```bash
rm projects
rm: cannot remove 'projects': Is a directory
```

To remove a directory and everything inside it, use `-r` or `-R` for recursive removal.

```bash
rm -r old-project
```

Recursive removal walks through the directory tree and removes files, subdirectories, and their contents.

## The Dangers of `rm -rf`

The command `rm -rf` combines recursive deletion with forceful deletion.

```bash
rm -rf old-project
```

This can be appropriate for removing generated folders such as build outputs, but it is dangerous because it removes a whole tree without asking questions. Always check:

- **Are you in the directory you think you are in?** Use `pwd`.
- **Did your wildcard expand correctly?** Preview with `ls`.
- **Is the path absolute or relative?** `/tmp/cache` and `tmp/cache` are very different.
- **Is there an accidental space?** `rm -rf old-project` and `rm -rf old project` target different paths.

## Using rmdir for Empty Directories

As a safer alternative, remove an empty directory with `rmdir`.

```bash
rmdir empty-directory
```

The `rmdir` command will only succeed if the directory is completely empty, making it a safer choice than `rm -r` for cleanup tasks.

## Common rm Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-i` | Prompt before every removal. |
| `-I` | Prompt once before removing more than three files or removing recursively. |
| `-f` | Force removal and ignore nonexistent files. |
| `-r`, `-R` | Remove directories and their contents recursively. |
| `-v` | Show what was removed (verbose). |

For example, you can combine options:

```bash
rm -rv old-project
removed 'old-project/notes.txt'
removed directory 'old-project'
```

## Common Questions

1. **Can I undo `rm`?** Usually, no. Once a file is removed there is no built-in undo. Backups, version control, and filesystem recovery tools are the real safety net.
2. **Why does `rm` say "Permission denied"?** You do not have permission to remove that file or to modify the directory containing it. Check ownership and permissions with `ls -l`.
3. **Why does `rm` say "No such file or directory"?** The file does not exist at that path, or you are in a different directory than you expected. Use `pwd` and `ls` to confirm.
4. **Should I use `sudo` with `rm`?** Only when you fully understand the path you are deleting. `sudo rm -r` can remove system files that your normal user account is not allowed to touch.
